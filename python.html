    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Python is a free general-purpose programming language with beautiful syntax. It is 
available across many platforms including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Due to its inherently easy to learn nature along with Object Oriented features, Python is used to develop 
and demonstrate applications quickly. Python has the “batteries included” philosophy 
wherein the standard programming language comes with a rich set of built-in libraries. 
It’s a known fact that developers spend most of the time reading the code than writing 
it and Python can speed up software development. Hosting solutions for Python applications are also very cheap. Python Software Foundation (PSF) nurtures the growth of 
Python programming language. A versatile language like Python can be used not only to 
write simple scripts for handling file operations but also to develop massively trafficked 
websites for corporate IT organizations</p>
 <h3>HISTORY OF PYTHON</h3>
 <p>The history of the Python programming language dates back to the late 1980s. Python was 
conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido 
van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming 
language capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. 
Van Rossum is Python’s principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the 
direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community. He is the 
“Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL), which means he continues to oversee Python development and retains the final say in disputes or arguments arising within the community Often people assume that the name Python was written after a snake. Even the logo of 
Python programming language  depicts the picture of two snakes, blue and 
yellow. But, the story behind the naming is somewhat different Back in the 1970s, there was a popular BBC comedy TV show called “Monty Python’s 
Flying Circus” and Van Rossum happened to be a big fan of that show. At the time when 
he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts 
from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.” It occurred to him that he needed a name that was 
short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language “Python".</p>
<h3>WHY PYTHON IS SO POPULAR???</h3>
<p>According to the TIOBE index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, Python is the third most popular programming language in the world, behind only Java and C. There are many reasons for the ubiquity of Python, including: 
<ul>
<li>Its ease of use. For those who are new to coding and programming, Python can be an excellent first step. It’s relatively easy to learn, making it a great way to start building your programming knowledge.</li>
<li>Its simple syntax. Python is relatively easy to read and understand, as its syntax is more like English. Its straightforward layout means that you can work out what each line of code is doing.</li> 
<li>Its thriving community. As it’s an open-source language, anyone can use Python to code. What’s more, there is a community that supports and develops the ecosystem, adding their own contributions and libraries.</li> 
<li>Its versatility. As we’ll explore in more detail, there are many uses for Python. Whether you’re interested in data visualisation, artificial intelligence or web development, you can find a use for the language.</li> </p></ul>
